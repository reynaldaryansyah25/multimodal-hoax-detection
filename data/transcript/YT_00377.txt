Harapan saya bahwa otorita itu My hope is that new center becomes not just a new city but a new model of government for Indonesia. But now some are questioning the project's future. Former president Joko Widodo who launched the relocation plan hailed last year's independent state ceremony in New Santara for the first time. But his successor, President Prabowo Subeyantu, moved this year's back to Jakarta. Since the change in president's budget reviews have slowed construction and hurt local businesses. At this guesthouse built four years ago, sales have fallen to less than a third of peak levels. The owner blames the slow progress for dampening customer traffic. We used to be full all the time but now we rent only one or two rooms a day. Investors in upscale accommodations are holding back until they see progress. The agency's head admits the budget reviews disrupted operations in the first half of the year and insists the project will go ahead. And that's a paradox in it. The relocation of our office here shows our commitment in action, not just words. There will be ups and downs in development. Prabowo Subeyantu, administrative, legislative and judicial facilities will be completed by 2028. But public opinion remains divided on the relocation.
