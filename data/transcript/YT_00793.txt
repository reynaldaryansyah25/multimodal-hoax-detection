amp crawling emang waktu kesajaran atau kembali unas konten buat curgita itu yang skiing Kar제 khuakbox Ketika aras berada orang yang villi segera, seseng tomorrow semera Satu ke semen seperti itu kalian dessus sekerima juga, Sama conventionsные... Awak mungkin mahu burst merasa semuanya jauhnya, Tidakkan recognizing kita dem fortunate di Celiquaya, Tapi ada yayaman nel она pesta Buildingway dan jangan hanya Benadori terlebih pretend, Vali punya antara siang göra Tapi, kelihatan yang saya memiliki untuk kamu hari ini adalah $1.56 per mil, dan akan memiliki 2 orang untuk 5 hari di sekolah sekolah. As I was researching school lunch prices for this video, I found this survey done by Deloitte, and I feel like I have a bone to pick with them, because who in the heck is spending $4.84 on a peanut butter sandwich, baby carrots, apple, and cookies? Not sure. All of this was $31.11, but meal for $1.87, and then 2 packs of muffins at $1.24 each. I also recommend getting the great value apple sauce pouches because they're cheaper, but my Walmart was out of that, so I got the name brand instead. So here's the meal plan based on the groceries that I got. So I'm gonna go ahead and hard boil all of these eggs. My kids aren't huge breakfast eaters. Sometimes they don't even eat breakfast, but if they do, they want something pretty small. So I'm gonna hard boil all of these eggs. We'll have those for breakfast, enough for one kid each day for five days, and then I'll have two extra that I can make into egg salad for lunch, if I want to, and then I'm also going to use this oatmeal. So there is eight packets in here. Sometimes I like to double up on the packets. It just depends on how hungry the kids are. If you have smaller kids, it's probably not an issue, but if you have bigger kids or teenagers, you might want to do two packets. And then these Martha White muffins, I love these. I used to actually use these packets in college all the time because they were so cheap. I can make a super, like, cheap dessert after dinner. And then also, if you look online, there's a recipe where you can make these into pancakes. They actually make really good pancakes. So you could do pancakes with these with the hard boiled eggs, or you could do a scrambled egg. But what I'm gonna do is just make these into regular muffins. You can also make mini muffins, but each one of these bags makes six muffins. So you have 12 muffins total, eight packets of oatmeal, and then your hard boiled eggs. And then the rest of the items are gonna be for lunches. So I'm gonna do sandwiches. This will be at least enough for two sandwiches per day for five days. And then I'll have an option either to do ham sandwiches or tuna salad. So I got four cans of tuna, which I can mix with mayo, salt and pepper, stretch that into five sandwiches. My daughter really likes tuna sandwiches. Conor does not. So I am gonna do the ham sandwiches for him. There's enough in here for five days of sandwiches. And then also there's 12 slices of cheese. So if you wanted to do a cheese sandwich, you could, I don't think my kids have. Have my kids ever ate a cheese sandwich? I mean, they've eaten a grilled cheese sandwich, but I don't know about just the plain cheese sandwich. But anyway, I'll combine the ham and the cheese for Conor. And then again, I'll have an option for egg salad. And then to go with it, chips. I think these chips are like such a great deal at Walmart. They're on sale right now for only $1.50 a bag. I priced the little bags of chips, and you could totally do those if you wanted to go for convenience. I think they actually have the great value brand of the individual size chips also. But I went with barbecue and cheddar sour cream. This will be more than enough for 10 lunches for the weight for two kids. And then on the side for the sandwich and chips, we're gonna do a cheese stick. The cheese sticks are the same price at Walmart, whether you get like the cheddar or the Colby Monterey Jack or the string cheese, so get whatever you want. And then this particular box of applesauce, they substituted me. So if you get the great value, 12 pack of applesauce pouches, it's like $4.97. They didn't have it when I ordered these. So I am substituting the mats, but definitely go with the great value because it's awesome. It tastes the same and it's way cheaper. And then lastly, a box of granola bar, and you get 10 in there. So it's perfect for two kids for five lunches. So I'm starting with the muffins, which are super easy to prep ahead of time. And since these muffins are basically just dump mix and bake, they come together so quickly and easily. Since I had two different flavors, I obviously mix them in two different bowls with the amount of milk that the bag called for. But if you want to get two bags of the same flavor, obviously you can mix them together, and that would be less dishes. I put some cupcake liners into my tin and sprayed those with a little bit of cooking spray. Yes, I'm using Christmas because I didn't have anything else. And then you just want to bake them for the package directions. One of the toothpick comes out clean. Then I'll just put them on a cooling rack to cool the rest of the way. These turn out so good. They are so cheap, quick, and easy, and they make a really good breakfast. So obviously on the side of our oatmeal and muffins, I'm going to make some hardwilled eggs. So I decided to try this method that I saw from America's Test Kitchen where you steam the eggs. So like hard boiled steamed eggs. And then you put them in an ice bath and let them sit. I have to say, maybe my eggs were too new, but this method did not work very well. So I probably would not recommend trying it. The best way I have found to do hard boiled eggs is in my dash egg cooker, followed closely by my instant pot. But it's always a struggle sometimes to get those eggs peeled. So for our two breakfasts, we've got muffins and hard boiled eggs and oatmeal and hard boiled eggs. I know it's not a super huge breakfast, but like I said, my kids aren't always big breakfast eaters. When I make tuna salad, I really like to make sure that the tuna is drained very thoroughly. So I typically do that in a mesh strainer. And then once the tuna is drained, I'll season it with some salt. My daughter really likes this Thai chili sauce in with her tuna salad. So I added some of that along with some mayo. Obviously just season it to taste. I added it to a container. I always like to label it and you're good to go for the week. Four cans of tuna salad will definitely make five tuna salad sandwiches. Now one thing you can do is keep the tuna separate from the bread and then have your kid assemble it themselves. Or you could add like two pieces of cheese on there to keep the bread from getting soggy unless you're going to eat it right away. So there's a couple options there. So this will be your easy lunches for the week. I was also able to make up a little bit of egg salad with the extra hard boiled eggs. But we've got sandwich chips, applesauce, a chees stick, and a granola bar. I know my kids would be very happy with this lunch. One thing I also wanted to talk about in this video is free and reduced school lunches. I'm of the mindset that every kid that goes to school should get free lunch. And I know there are some states that do that. However, eligibility is based in most states off of the federal poverty guidelines. So here is the chart that details that basically if you're a family of four in your annual income is under $59,478. You qualify for reduced lunches. And if it's under $41,795, you qualify for free school lunches. I'll put some resources down below for free and reduced school lunches. But typically you can get an application through your school and they can help you with that.
