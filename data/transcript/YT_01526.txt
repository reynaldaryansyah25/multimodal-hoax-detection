 people expect the United States to continue playing roles to promote peace, promote stability, and promote prosperity around the world. And in order to do that, they're going to be competing priorities, and that is inevitable. The idea that we're just going to focus on one region and not others makes no sense. I think the key is how do we balance that? Southeast Asia and the wider Indo-Pacific continue to be strategic priorities for the U.S. set ambassador Edgar D. Kagan as Washington and Pujra Jaya seek to build on the strong rapport between their leaders. In an exclusive interview with FMT, Kagan dismissed suggestions that the region was being neglected, despite concerns that domestic tensions and a renewed focus on the Middle East may be drawing attention elsewhere. My expectation is that in classic fashion, no matter what the United States does, it will never be seen as quite enough by countries in the region. And I would also note that it is not a zero-sum game. For years, regional governments have lamented the strategic vacuum left by the U.S. with Washington appearing to retreat from global leadership, amid ongoing trade wars and rising security tensions, particularly in the South China Sea. Kagan said President Donald Trump's latest visit to the region, including to Malaysia, was proof of Washington's resolve to stay anchored in Asia with the U.S. choosing the Indo-Pacific as its launch pad for a new wave of reciprocal trade agreements. Malaysia, U.S. relations reached a new high last month after Prime Minister Anwar Ibrahim and Trump signed a landmark agreement upgrading relations to a comprehensive strategic partnership, which Kagan said was strengthened by recent joint efforts to resolve the Thai Cambodia border standoff. What we saw in this case was the two leaders really hit it off. What was interesting though was you could see the rapport billed over the course of the visit. The relationship clearly is excellent. They've had a number of phone conversations. I was present for one of the phone conversations, and it's very clear that they get along very well. Donald Shorjureza, FMP.
