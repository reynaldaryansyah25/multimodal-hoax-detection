Today's signing represents just one of eight conflicts that we've ended in eight months of the Trump President and Sambury honor to have done it. We saved millions of lives. It also includes the end of the war in Gaza. We've found a very strong agreement. We have 59 countries involved. And we have numerous of them right here at this table. Like as an example, Indonesia, my new friend. Thank you very much for helping. We appreciate it. I want to thank Malaysian Brunei as well as my friend, President Prabowo, of Indonesia for their incredible support of these efforts to secure the new day for the Middle East. It really is a new day. There's never been a period of time like this. The Middle East will have peace after 3,000 years. This is a very strong peace. It's going to be an everlasting peace. It's true. It really is a true pleasure to be back with all of you in Southeast Asia, almost some of America's most important allies and countries and partners. In the entire world, they look up to you. I'm here in a mission of friendship and goodwill, and to deepen our ties of commerce, to strengthen our common security, and to really promote strongly stability, prosperity, and peace for all of the countries in this room, and long beyond this room. That's why I'm delighted that in addition to the agreement with Malaysia this week, we're also signing our nearing completion on trade deals with many other Indo-Pacific partners from Cambodia to Japan to South Korea. We're delighted to forge richer partnerships on energy technology, artificial intelligence, critical minerals and other industries the United States is having its golden age. Last year we were a country that was doing very poorly under a different semi-leadership. I don't even go out of leadership, but this year we're doing numbers that nobody ever thought it was possible for any country to do. We'll be at the end of my first year, over $20 trillion worth of investment into the United States is no country anywhere that's ever done anything close to that. The United States last year, for the four years, it was announced, did less than $1 trillion and we're going to be doing over $20. That's quite a difference. I'd like to just say the United States is for you. It's committed to a free and open and thriving Indo-Pacific. My message to the nations of Southeast Asia is that the United States is with you 100 percent and we intend to be a strong partner and friend for many generations to come. One year ago we were in a different position, but now we're in the best position we've ever been. I really do. I say it's the golden age of America, the golden age of the United States together will create incredible prosperity for the nations on both sides of the Pacific Ocean and to seize new opportunities for all of our people. It's really been an amazing experience. I've been here for a day, but it's been an amazing experience to see some of the things that you've done and the Prime Minister made sure I saw everything, every single thing. When I said, well, that's okay, maybe I'll take it easy for a little while. I said, no, no, I have other things to show you. We even rode in the car together and he's something. But America ties to this region date back to early days of our republic when fearless Americans voyage across the Pacific to establish outposts of trade and diplomacy here in Asia. Those bonds forged so long ago continue to strengthen and grow to this day, including here in Kuala Lumpur. I'm looking forward to speaking with many of you today, and also at APEC in South Korea later this week, where we're heading. Once again, thank you very much, Mr. Prime Minister, and thank you to everyone in this room. You are spectacular leaders. You are incredible people. You are energy, you are genius, you are everything you do. I say it truly, everything you touch turns to gold. And you can be very proud of it. Other parts of the world are not like this. You're very special people, and it's a very, very special place. Thank you very much. We're going down to be with you. Thank you. Thank you, Mr. President. Thank you, Mr. President.
