 In a significant show of assertiveness Pakistan's naval chief Admiral Nawid Ashraf has visited the disputed Sir Creek area along the India Pakistan Maritime Boundary. Top intelligence sources reveal that Admiral Nawid Ashraf's visit to the Creek area has a deliberate attempt to project military assertiveness in disputed maritime zones. They are deliberately doing this before Indian Tri-Forses joint exercise. This shows Islamabad's intent to internationalize the Sir Creek dispute and convey deterrence against India's enhanced naval activity near the Gulf of Karcinari. Sedang back to you, how does this Admiral Nawid Ashraf's visit to the disputed Sir Creek area, combined with the induction of the new hovercraft, reflect Pakistan's broader maritime strategy you think? Well that's right, so Manoj is bringing for us where Pakistan's naval chief visits disputed Creek area along India Pakistan border, Pakistan's aggression towards disputed Sir Creek. Pakistan knows how to defend our sovereignty and every inch of our maritime frontiers. This is what Naval chief said. The sea lines of communication and maritime security is not just a military requirement. It's hard to understand Pakistan's sovereignty, part of the geese and fixed new weapons and patroling fleet. During the visit, you know, the hovercrafts are also inducted into Pakistan's range, marking another significant strike. In modern-adventure Pakistan Navy's operations capabilities, the newly inducted hovercrafts are capable of simultaneously operating over a variety of surfaces including cattle, water, sand dunes, bargey and bogey zones and can fly in areas where traditional crafts are neither suitable nor designed to operate. Now this unique capability of undertaking simultaneous operations over land and sea-providing and its departments in the performance of their ASI staff, the admiral for the reattuated that the sea lines of communication and maritime security is not just a military requirement, it is a bonus form of Pakistan's sovereignty. The top-intil forces are telling this to Manojusa that the admiral Navi-Astrop visits the sea area as a deliberate attempt to protect military assertiveness. They are deliberately doing this support Indian tribal forces to exercise this. This shows Islamabad's interns and engineers nationalize the search, the dispute and send-away deterrence in India. In-camp, they will actually be meeting at the Gulf of Pakistan and they will see the induction of the hovercrafts as a different type of breed. The specified Chinese presence and cooperation and other secret to other Tewani maritime armprayla also haven't said that. There has been condemnation coming from the Balochis. Perhaps the Pakistan army is violating their Balochis land and deliberately aggressive Manojusa is being done by the foreign hovercrafts by visiting the third-week area. So even the Balochis are against the move of the Pakistani army. Right, so to what extent does Pakistan's emphasis and sea lines of communication and references to sovereignty from the South Korea to the South Korea? How might this reshape regional naval dynamics in the Arabian sea region you think? Well, in fact, some of the bad news about the wild addressing media in the National Capitol almost a month back said that Pakistan is doing build-up in the South Korea area, military build-up in the South Korea area. So the Indian side was very well aware of this move by the Pakistani forces. And having said that, definitely, this move justifies Chinese presence and cooperation under the secret Guazard, Giovanni maritime umbrella. And in fact, they look at it as a defensive move, but it's an aggressive move and also to continue trying to continue, thinking of containing Indian marine powers in India, the Arabian sea. So that's an idea. And perhaps they have never seen that it does not have to do with the military requirements, but has to do with the trade and sea lines of communication etc etc. But everybody understands that why Pakistan is doing it on who's the head Pakistan is doing this by deploying hovercrafts etc. So everybody understands that and perhaps this is coming ahead of the price of its exercises which India will be conducting in the Arabian sea. Right.
