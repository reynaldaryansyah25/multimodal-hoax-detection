Angger had been building since President Prabowo took office last year. Stoke by lawmakers, pocketing allowances nearly ten times the average Indonesian minimum wage. Now, seven officers are in custody. But the driver who killed Affaan still remains unknown. In Jakarta, one young man's death has become the symbol of a nation's fury. And that fury is still burning. Let's go to Jakarta now and talk to our correspondent, Ferdinand Hemmawan. Ferdinand, how is the situation there this morning? When I drive through the streets today, this morning from my home to the studio, I can see that there are some public facilities have been burnt down during the protests, such as the bus stops, the toll gates, several police stations and several police vehicles has been burnt down in the streets. And the major toll routes in Jakarta are still closed and the people are still cleaning up after the protests. But, and Jakarta is not the only place that the protest was happening. It was happening also in other big cities in Indonesia, such as Makasar, Solo and stuff. But I can say that for now, the situation is getting more conducive and hopefully it can get more conducive and not escalate even more from now on. Ferdinand, these protests erupted after a motorcycle taxi driver was killed by a police vehicle. But then there was the wider demonstrations that expressed the kind of public discontent. Tell us more about what the protesters want or what they're protesting against. Yeah, that's correct. The death of the motorcycle taxi driver was the trigger that make this protest reached its peak. But the initial focus of this protest was because the bad economic situation in the country that was created by the bad economic policy from the government. The government kept increasing the tax. The living cost is increasing. But the people's economic situation is hard. They are facing mass layoffs. They are facing low wages and the unemployment rate is getting higher. On the other hand, when they are facing that, they heard that the MPs got a fantastic salary and increased how's benefit that is 10 times bigger than the minimum wage in Jakarta. That makes the people angry. But what makes the people really angry is the response from one of the MPs that are mocking the protesters, that are protesting against the fantastic salary of the MPs. So what we saw in the past two days, that is how the public expressing their frustration towards the government and the hellish in this country. At the same time after the death of this motorcycle driver, we saw that President Subyanto apologized. Did those actions appear to be calming the situation? Actually, in the statement, President Prabosubian, Subyanto didn't say sorry to the people. They didn't apologize to the people. They are just saying condolences to the death motorcycle taxi driver. But it seems like that the government still not unsensitive to the people's condition. And this situation can be deescalated only if the government really listens and also have the empathy to the people to really give what they want and really just talk to them. That kind of action can really deescalate the tension in Jakarta and also in Indonesia. Alright, that's DW's third non-hemal-want in Jakarta talking about those protests. Ferdinand, thank you.
