It's an honor to build on that successful security relationship along standing one. And a couple of items. I want to thank you for your leadership on the International Stability and Security Force in Gaza, which you have lean forward on. And we're in partnership with you on your commitment to advancing President Trump's vision for lasting peace following the historic peace deal that he broke with this month is exceptional. Thank you. And on a lot of fronts, our militaries work closely together to tackle security issues such as things like maritime security.
