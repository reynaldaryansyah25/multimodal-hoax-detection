 Well, the problem is, as you guys know, I am an eternal optimist. However, I am terrified, like hide under the bed, terrified, that this city can essentially fall to ruin, which is what would happen if Mamdani wins. And what I'm not quite sure is when you have President Obama coming out and making the call and sure not making a full-throated endorsement, but it was a ding, substantive step in that direction. Who is Mamdani's biggest challenger at this moment? Andrew Cuomo, a strong establishment Democrat, whose policies align pretty perfectly along with President Obama's. Incremental, progressive reform within financial and fiscal responsibility, climate action, affordability, LGBTQ rights, etc. But yet, he has not said anything about Andrew Cuomo. And instead, he's caught up in the energy of Mamdani, a blatant anti-Semite that refuses to condemn Hamas or talk about the terrorism threat on this soil. And he is somehow implying, in my opinion, that the optics of supporting Cuomo, you know, the sexual harassment, cloud, and the shame, the optics of this aging out Democrat-established person, regardless of the Cuomo family, is somehow more of a taint than Mamdani. That is all you need to know about the Democrat Party, that they have completely sacrificed ideals and prioritizing. Remember, they were the party of values. Everything out of their mouth is about skin color and gender until the person is actually rooted in common sense, like Winsom Sears. And then it is crickets. And who I blame to are those ridiculous, self-serving, and self-satisfying upper-class, you know, white women, like Mikey Sherrill, Mickey Sherrill, oh, it can never be answering. Who's sitting there being like, mm-hmm, as Obama is saying these comments, you are most of the problem. And now Obama is just the mouthpiece for it. But that phoniness that you talk about, that has riddled and adult the Democrat Party.
