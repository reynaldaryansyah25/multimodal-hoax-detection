The investigation is still underway at 15 provincial police headquarters. As authorities continue gathering evidence, before moving the process forward. PAGEO's family denies that he was anything other than peaceful and say that the protesters are being punished for speaking up. I hope everyone will soon realize this is not just about Pedro and all the activists who have been arrested, but about democracy itself. It's about all of us. It's not known how many protesters exactly are behind bars. Police did not respond to repeated requests by DW and others to release the current number of detainees. Ya, saya lihat bahwa police are not transparent, not accountable in relation to arrests, detentions, and also the naming of suspects from various parties in civil society, who are then accused of being perpetrators of violence. Other rights groups are also in the case. A mest international says it's seeing a broader pattern of repression. With the various cases that we have observed in the past year, there has been a lot of excessive force, arrests, arrests of the innocent, torture, and even unfair death in the tragedy of August. We are concerned that Indonesia is no longer a democratic country that guarantees civil freedom. The situation is causing alarm among ordinary citizens as well as respected public figures. They only want Indonesia to be a sovereign country, in which one is free to speak out and express opinions. A few shared by Dilpadrumar Hans family, together with others, they've now joined the weekly protest to demand transparency from the authorities and a fair trial for those who are currently behind bars. Human rights consultant Phil Robertson is based in Bangkok. Phil, hundreds of people still being detained. Are those arrests in violation of international human rights? Well, it's quite clear that many of those people who are still in detention have faced abuses at the hands of the police while in detention, including beatings, cases of detainees being burnt with cigarettes and other abuses. Many of them who are being held are also people who are involved in simply expressing their opinions or peacefully demonstrating. Now, of course, there are some that were involved in violence. We saw very clearly that some of these protesters were throwing stones at the police. Some cases, they took down sort of bamboo poles that were being used to hang flags and attack the police with those. But it doesn't appear that the police have effectively sorted out the violent offenders versus the ones who were simply there protesting and demanding that there be accountability for what had happened by the police. And opposing the police's excessive use of force, which was apparent to all. What would you say all of this says about the state of democracy in Indonesia? Well, it's very clearly slipping. And we're dealing with a president in President Prabowo who people should not forget was someone who was accused of serious human rights abuses when he was in the military, including the disappearance of a number of students in 1998 whose cases have never been solved. I think we're really seeing a backsliding on human rights and democracy in Indonesia, a government that refuses to be held accountable for actions by the police. And now what we see is the police being assigned to consider reforms of the police, but it's the police themselves that are judging themselves. And we're not going to see any justice from that. It's just more buying time and hoping that the temperature on the street slowly declines. So who can hold the government to account? Well, I mean, I think that ultimately we have to look at some of the international community, including some of the donors to Indonesia, some of the partners, the trading partners of Indonesia. It's important for, for instance, the office of the I Commissioner for Human Rights and the UN to get more involved here. And I also think that it's important for the people of Indonesia to be listened to by the government. This is ostensibly a democratic government, even though it does seem to be sliding backwards in a very serious and concerted way. And in the meantime, what's going to happen to those held in custody, those being unfairly treated, as you mentioned as well, and those who weren't involved in any violence in those protests? Well, there's just over 950 people have been named as suspects, including almost 300 children. So there's a very serious component of these detained protesters who are children. We're expecting that the trials will really start towards the end of November or early December. It's very likely that once those trials do start, that we'll see renewed protests, including the trials of people like Delperado, who was mentioned in your report, who very clearly is someone who was not involved in violence, but was simply one of the organizers and the strategists of the protests to demand accountability from the national assembly and from the executive in Indonesia.
