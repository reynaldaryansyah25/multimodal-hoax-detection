 Terus President Trump threatens military action against another country, this time Nigeria, saying, and I quote him, if we attack, it will be fast, vicious and sweet. CNN is learning what sparked Trump's ire against Nigeria. It came down to a segment on Fox, and Alainatreen is out front live from the White House. And Alainat, pretty incredible that that would be the case here. What have you learned? Yeah, well, what I was told, Aaron, from two sources who were familiar with how this all happened, was that the president was headed to Florida on Friday. He was watching Fox News on the big screen. And essentially, he saw the segment that Fox was doing on how Christians were being targeted by Islamic groups in Nigeria. And very quickly after that, one of the sources says it was immediate that he, it sparks some anger in him. And he began to inquire about it, asking his staff to be better read on it. But what was interesting was that shortly after he had touched down on Air Force One, he had just taken the beast, his presidential motorcade, Tumar Al-Lago, is when you saw that first post from him. And it read, quote, Christianity is facing an existential threat in Nigeria. Thousands of Christians are being killed. Radical Islamists are responsible for this mass slaughter. He went on to add that he wants to make Nigeria a, quote, country of particular concern. Now, what was interesting about this is, of course, for anyone who was paying attention to history social over the weekend. This became a major focal point of hers on Saturday and Sunday as well. He talked about potential military action in the region. And he was also asked directly last night, when he was flying back on Air Force One, if that could mean potential U.S. boots on the ground or strikes in Nigeria. And the president did not rule it out. But I will say, Aaron, in one of my conversations with people in the Trump administration, they essentially told me that a lot of this is the president making threats to see how Nigeria will respond. One of them said it was a quote, art of the deal type of strategy that he is deploying here. And they've tried to argue that in some ways it's working. You know, the media is giving more attention to it. But all of this comes as we know as well, that the Pentagon, the president had directed his Secretary of Defense, Pete Hegg-Zeth, to look into this. They have begun moving now some personnel to the back to the region after they had told them to leave essentially a year ago. And so we have to see where this could all lead. All right, Elena, thank you very much. All that new reporting from Elena. The State Department has designated Nigeria as a country of particular concern over claims by President Trump that the Nigerian government is not doing enough to protect Christians from terror groups like Boko Haram. For us to tell CNN, Trump has been laser-focused on the treatment of Christians in the African country. After a report he saw on Fox News while traveling aboard Air Force One and just 24 hours later, he posted on truth social that the United States will cut off aid and go into Nigeria guns ablasing. He confirmed the possibility of military intervention to reporters. The White House tells CNN that President Trump has been tracking this issue for some time, even both for his segment, and it already considered posting about it. Nigeria is a country of 230 million people, equal parts Christian and Muslim, and both Muslims and Christians have fallen victim to violence from terrorist groups like Boko Haram. But some high profile killings targeting Christians this year have drawn the attention to President Trump and many Republicans, including an attack on a predominantly Christian farming community located on a very crucial area of farm land that killed at least 100 people. For me now, it's found that executive director of the National Security Institute, Jim Eljaffer, has seen a military analyst retired Colonel Satrik Layton. Let's talk about the scope of the issue. Trump is saying that Nigeria is allowing the slaughter of Christians. Do we know if this is true and the extent this might be happening? Well, certainly, Nigeria is not allowing the slaughter of Christians or Muslims for that matter. In fact, the Nigerian government is working very hard within the resource constraints that they have to actually fight Boko Haram, which is the main group that is actually attacking mainly Christians, but they're also attacking Muslims in the northern part of the country. So what you're seeing is really a state trying to provide counterinsurgency forces to the region and trying to engage in counterinsurgency operations. Success? No, they're not there yet. They definitely have some problems taking care of this from a mission standpoint. But the issue is that the Nigerian government needs help not in occupying force to come in there. Boko Haram has been a tariff for a very long time. The Nigerian government has responded to they're actually shocked, they're mulling an invasion to their country for this very reason. What is the best course of action to deal with what's going on? Yeah, well, look, there are really two or three different issues going on in Nigeria. You've got Boko Haram in the north, you've got bandits in the northwest, you've got a fight between farmers and herders, people who are nomadic tribesmen, who have long been in conflict. It's really, there are religious dynamics to it, but a lot of it is really about economics and resources. And so what the government really needs, I think, to Colonel Layton's point is exactly right. They need counterterrorism support. Unfortunately, we got pushed out of Niger, a neighboring country just a year ago. The closest forces we have are in Djibouti, quite a distance away. Our headquarters for African-Command, for Africa, is in Germany. So we don't have a lot of resources to bring to bear on this problem. The best we could probably muster is some counterterrorism strikes, but those would be probably not against the Nigerian government, but in favor of the Nigerian government, which to Colonel Layton's point is that you try to stop these attacks on Christians and Muslims in their country. So what would the military be doing there? I mean, we're not giving all those resources, where would the American military come in? So this would be one of the hardest missions to plan because counterterrorism missions by their nature are difficult. And so what you'd have to do is you'd have to get permission from the Nigerians to go in there and to go into the right place. You need ironclad intelligence. That's something that they're not doing in Venezuela, for example. They are just attacking targets as they see them. That is not the way to do this kind of thing. What you need to do is you need to find out who the people are, where they're located, who the most important ones are, and then eliminate those. And that's the most efficient way to do that. We've done that before in Iraq. We've done it in Afghanistan. But in the case of Nigeria, you were talking about a vast country that's 37% larger than Texas in terms of square miles. And it's 200, like you mentioned, 230 million people plus. And it's a very complicated, really difficult area to work in. Yeah. Concrete intelligence requires trust and getting permission from the government that they want to deploy these resources would require total lockdown and information. Do we have that? Well, it doesn't look like it, right? I mean, our resources and the region are constrained. We've largely sort of taken our hands off the tiller when it comes to counterterrorism efforts around the globe. For the better part of the decade, we've been downplaying and downtrending our counterterrorism missions. We had a few successes here and there. We got Amon Al-Zawahiri. Right? We got Cosmos Soleimani. Right? We've been successful. Our partners in the Israelis and at least have been very successful against a number of terrorist groups in their region. But in Africa and frankly in Southeast Asia as well, we have reduced our charatism footprint. In part because we have multiple administrations who said we need to focus here at home, including President Trump on campaign trail. So it's actually good to see President Trump getting more concerned about terrorism in our hemisphere with the efforts against Venezuelan drug traffickers who ease caste as terrorists. And frankly, the real terrorists, Al-Qaeda and the Islamic State, who are operating actively in a range of parts of the world, including predominantly in West Africa. We see them about take over the government in Mali. That's a huge problem. And we've seen R.I. off that ball. Of course, the narcotarrism, we're waiting for information from the administration for transparency as to what's happening on those boats. Who's there? We do require a due process in this country. You were agreeing? Well, yeah, in fact, what Jamil is saying is absolutely right, because we could see within days the takeover of the country of Mali, which is to the northwest of Nigeria. And that would mean that Al-Qaeda sympathetic people are going to actually be in charge of a country for the first time ever. And they're going to be able to use that as a springboard for attacks in the rest of Africa and potentially for attacks in Europe and possibly even in the Americas. So this is going to be a really important development and we have to really pay attention to this. The capital is surrounded, Bama-ko, of Mali is surrounded by rebel forces right now. They're fuel shortages. And that's the kind of thing that is going to lead to the fall of that government. And that'll be dangerous for Nigeria as well.
