 U.S. President Donald Trump has marked the significant moment in Southeast Asia on Sunday, October 26. Signing key agreements with Cambodia and Thailand during a regional summit. At a ceremony in Kuala Lumpur, Trump finalized a reciprocal trade deal with Cambodia, strengthening economic ties between the two nations. In parallel, he signed a U.S. agreement with Thailand focused on critical minerals, a sector increasingly vital for technology and energy security. A White House official confirmed that Trump is also set to sign a similar critical minerals deal with Malaysia during the ongoing ASEAN summit, signaling Washington's commitment to regional cooperation and strategic resource partnerships. These agreements come on the heels of an expanded ceasefire pact between Thailand and Cambodia. The ceremony brought together leaders from the region, highlighting both diplomatic and economic collaboration. For President Trump, the deals underscore the importance of trade, minerals, and security in maintaining stability in Southeast Asia, as ASEAN leaders and the U.S. work to strengthen ties. These agreements are seen as a move to enhance regional peace while ensuring that strategic resources remain accessible and secure for the United States and its partners.
